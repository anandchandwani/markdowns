##AUTHORS PREFACE

<p>SIEMonster Version 1 was released in late April of 2016. The release has been an astounding success without over 12,000 downloads of the product in under 4 months. We have assisted individuals and companies integrate SIEMonster into small medium and extra-large companies all around the world. SIEMonster with the help of the community and paid developers have been working hard since the Version1 release incorporating what the community wanted to see in a SIEM as well as things we wanted to see in the next release.</p>

<p>Along the way we have signed up MSSP’s from around the world who have contributed to the rollout of SIEMonster and in return they have assisted us with rollout scripts, ideas and things we hadn’t even considered.</p> 

<p> We have removed Graylog and FIR from Version 2 and replaced it with 411, a fantastic open source product which includes graphic rule correlation ruleset. </p>

* All new user interface to replace Graylog, supporting SPLUNK similar queries & alert assignment 
  to specific users/groups.
